# #CodingisFun
This repo is for storing all my personal projects as I learn to code. These projects will be practical applications of learned programming concepts. I'll try to repeat the same projects in different coding languages as I learn them in due course. 

These are the files currently stored in the repo:

1. [*HelloWorld.py*](https://github.com/NKGachoki/-CodingisFun/blob/main/HelloWorld.py)
2. [*Variables.py*](https://github.com/NKGachoki/-CodingisFun/blob/main/Variables.py)
3. [*If...else.py*](https://github.com/NKGachoki/-CodingisFun/blob/main/If...else.py)
4. [*While.py*](https://github.com/NKGachoki/-CodingisFun/blob/main/While.py)
5. [*Forloop.py*](https://github.com/NKGachoki/-CodingisFun/blob/main/Forloop.py)
