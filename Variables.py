# Variables are reserved memory locations that can be used to store values
# One typically creates a variable and assigns a value to it, for example, a = 10
#'a' is the variable and '10' is the value assigned to it.
# The program below contains some variables and will print out those variables

a = 10
b = 15

print(a, b)
